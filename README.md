# VersionOne Integration for Buy A Feature

The VersionOne Integration for Buy A Feature helps product planners collaborate with customers to better understand and prioritize their backlog. This integration bootstraps the creation of Buy A Feature Games from items in a VersionOne backlog. After virtual collaboration, Buy A Feature reports the game status and purchase counts back to VersionOne to help in the prioritization process.

## Code Coming Soon!
